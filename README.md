## About Me

Software Engineer with proven expertise in backend development, distributed systems, and secure application architecture. Currently working at CSC e-Governance Services India Limited, building enterprise-grade solutions for government infrastructure. Previously led backend development at Reticen8 Technologies, architecting DRM systems with secure file handling, license management, and real-time synchronization across distributed portals.

Strong foundation in building RESTful APIs, designing layered architectures, and implementing policy-based access control systems. Experienced in working with both modern frameworks (Django, Flask, Laravel, Spring Boot) and legacy systems (PHP Phalcon). Committed to writing maintainable code, solving complex algorithmic challenges, and delivering production-ready systems.
